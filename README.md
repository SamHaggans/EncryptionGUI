# EncryptionGUI
A Java Encryption program GUI, created by Sam Haggans as an Computer Science IA project.

If you find any bugs, please let me know.

Development is mostly finished, but I am still making some improvements to this project.

# How to Use
The EncryptionGUI.jar file can be used to run this program as an executable. However,
to run it, you will need to download the Java Development Kit, available here: 
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.
Download Java there (I am not affiliated with Oracle or Java), and then install it.
Once it is installed, you should be able to run the .jar file and the encryption program should run itself. Do note that it will create a
few configuration files in your home directory, so just beware of that. It doesn't do anything outside of where you would logically check.
If, for whatever reason you wanted to see what files it is generating, simply check in /<Your Username>/EncryptionGUI and the files will
be shown there, or in Google Drive if you chose that option on setup.
