# EncryptionGUI
A Java Encryption program GUI, created by Sam Haggans.
This project is still in development, and does not work completely yet. It also is not fully secure at this time (there is no password to lock files.)
Development is still continuing.
This is an IA project for Computer Science.

# How to Use
Eventually, a JAR file will be added to this project. This file will allow you to run the program as an executable. However,
to run it, you will need to download the Java Development Kit, available here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.
Download Java there (I am not affiliated with Oracle or Java), and then install it.
Once it is installed, you should be able to run the .jar file and the encryption program should run itself.
